About the program:
This program is built upon 4 classes, that creates a shape according to the users input. the shapes are a Rectangle, Window, Triangle and Hexagram. 
We included four files for each class including the given files for the exersize.

About the files:
In the". h" file contains the object and the functions and variables we use for the  object class.. The ".cpp" contains the functions 
implementations  from the objects accordingly ".h" and same goes for the constructors.

in the case of the rectangle, we were able to reuse constructors due to the similarity in variable types. 

Concerns:
we werent sure if for the triangle and the other shapes we should check if all two or more points are equal since we didnt find
any explicit information regrading this scenario.
